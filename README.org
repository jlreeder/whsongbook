* Mission
The West House Songbook is an open-source songbook. Its mission is to provide simple transcriptions of lyrics and chords to pop and folk songs for group singalongs. It began as a Word document, and is now a web app.

* Browsing
To view the songbook go to [[http://whsongbook.herokuapp.com/][whsongbook.herokuapp.com]].
* Contributing
Corrections, suggestions, additions, and other contributions are welcome. For details on how to contribute, see the following page: [[file:documentation/contribute.org][Contribute]].
* Acknowledgments
This songbook was born out of the West House community, and if it weren't for so many open dinners and Friday singalongs, I would have had neither the idea nor the motivation to put in so many hours to improve the book.

For song transcription, I'm grateful to those members of West House who first began the songbook and those who have helped me to expand it.

The mason jar illustration was created by Marguerite Preston. For more about her writing and her baking see [[margueritepreston.com][http://margueritepreston.com/]].

I have Chris Angelico (aka Rosuav) to thank for many hours of Python mentorship and for defining, editing, and correcting much of the digital machinery. More about Rosuav: [[https://github.com/rosuav][github.com/rosuav]].

As mentioned in ~Syntax~ above, particulars of the song markup syntax were inspired by LilyPond and Chordii. More info about LilyPond: [[http://lilypond.org/][lilypond.org]]. More info about Chordii: [[http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/][vromans.org]].

I first learned about folk fake books at the Lair of the Golden Bear, and I modeled my own work here on the Lair Songbook. More about the Lair: [[http://alumni.berkeley.edu/lair][alumni.berkeley.edu]].
